HOW TO expand my knowledge and life possibilities by working on prototype experiences

create a project in Logseq for current prototypes
Choose a few prototypes that I can do in parallel, and put them in the new project
write or modify a program to begin work on those prototypes
write or modify a program to make sure I also work on the other prototypes
