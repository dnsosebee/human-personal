HOW TO take full advantage of my great ideas generated in the forest.

Open my journal
First, do LIFE on everything up until the DYL
Then, do LIFE on DYL: for each star, make sure to do the action item, or schedule it. For other important items, move them into Logseq. Either into [[things to do]], or into a reasonable spot.
Write down your prototypes in Logseq
Write a program to help yourself start doing prototypes, and schedule it.
Mark your journal as complete (star). That's it!
